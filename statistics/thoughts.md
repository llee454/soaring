FLARM and Collision Avoidance Technologies
==========================================

1. temptation for pilots to rely on technologies and slacken See and Avoid scanning.
2. temptation encouraged by reliability claims made by manufacturers in advertising.
3. simple model: assume 1/1000 failure of lookout. assume 1/100 failure of electronic devices. assume 1/2 discontinue See and Avoid scans when using technology. result: increase rate of fatal collisions following introduction of technology.
4. mitigation: require manufactures to publish "field" failure rates - not theoretical lab failure rates. Require manuefactures to track rates of failures, glitches, bug reports, etc. Incolcate the importance of not relying on electronic devices during training. Personally treat FLARM as having a child in the back seat - an extra pair of eyes, but you wouldn't rely on it.
